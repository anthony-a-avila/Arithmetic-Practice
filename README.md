# Arithmetic Practice

This program is designed to assist a tutor in helping a student build proficiency in fundamental arithmetic operations.
It generates random arithmetic problems involving addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, squares, and cubes.

The program is intended to be used in the following way:
1. The tutor reads each arithmetic expression aloud to the student.
2. The student responds by giving the answer aloud, without looking at the screen.
3. The tutor can press ENTER to reveal the correct answer, and move on to the next problem.
4. In later rounds, the tutor may ask the student to use pencil and paper to compute answers for more complex problems,
    such as multiplication of larger numbers or divisions that involve remainders.

This approach helps remediate gaps in the student's understanding by reinforcing mental arithmetic before progressing 
to more advanced topics like algebra.
